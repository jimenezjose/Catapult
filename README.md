# catapult
With the command of an IR remote, within the range of 20 ft, a micro servo will turn 90 degrees to launch the catapult.

Supplies Needed: (One of each)

1. Arduino UNO or perferably an Adafruit's Circuit Playground 
2. IR sensor 
3. IR remote
4. red Led
5. Micro Servo
6. Pathfinders Medieval Catapult Wooden Kit 

About:
Shooting a catapult is fun and all but it would be better if we were able to shoot the catapult from a distance. That is why I made this project, so that anybody, will be able to launch a catapult with the command of an IR remote.

Extra: If you are using Adafruit's Circuit Playground uncomment the code that I have commented for you. The lines will end in "*****". For example:

#include <Adafruit_CircuitPlayground>      //load library... //https://github...Playground  *****
